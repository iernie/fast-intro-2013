Fast intro competition entry at The Gathering 2013. Made in ~4 hours. A story about a fight between a cyborg geisha and cyborg goat. 
(Cyborgs, geishas and goats was the given theme for the given competition. Don't ask, it's Fast Intro!)

Probably works best in Chrome (not Chromium!). Made with [three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/).
